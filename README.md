## 🚀 About Me

**Computer Science graduate** focused on data analysis and dashboard development. I enjoy using data visualization to help solve business problems.

I gained practical experience during the **MSIB Batch 6 program at RevoU**, where I built a web-based **Pizza Sales Dashboard**. To further improve my skills, I developed several personal projects, including an **E-commerce Dashboard**, a **Stationery Store Performance Dashboard**, and an **Ethereum Price Prediction app** using Python and Streamlit.

Through these projects, I learned how to process data efficiently and build simple Machine Learning models using **TensorFlow**. I am currently deepening my knowledge in **Business Intelligence** and am eager to start my career in the data and technology industry.
